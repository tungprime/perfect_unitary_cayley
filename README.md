# A complete classification of perfect unitary Cayley graphs

This Git repository contains the code we wrote in order to generate and conduct experiments with unitary Cayley graphs over a finite ring (possibly non-commutative)
as discussed in our paper:

**[1]** Ján Mináč, Tung T. Nguyen, Nguyen Duy Tan  *A complete classification of perfect unitary Cayley graphs* (preprint, 2024).

## Description

Our code uses the SageMath 10.4 kernel and the Python library NetworkX. It includes functions for constructing unitary Cayley graphs over a finite ring.  We also 
describe a procedure for finding induced odd-cycles on these graphs.
